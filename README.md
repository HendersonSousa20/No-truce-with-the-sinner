# **🕵️‍♂️ No Truce with the Sinner – Official Website**

## **🖤 Overview**

Welcome to the **No Truce with the Sinner** website, a digital reflection of the noir RPG where sanity is as fleeting as justice. This website is not just a portal; it’s a dive into the psyche of a game world where your choices define everything, and the darkness is never far behind.

Our goal was simple: to create a site that **feels** as complex and unsettling as the game it represents. Using a sophisticated mix of **parallax scrolling**, subtle **neural animations**, and **immersive design**, we blur the lines between player and character. **No Truce with the Sinner** is an experience in itself—through the web, it pulls you in deeper.

## **🛠️ Technology Stack**

- **HTML5**: The backbone that structures our descent into madness.
- **CSS3**: Styling that balances beauty and brutality, weaving dark themes with elegance.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Fueling interactions and animations that make the site come alive, echoing the tension of the game’s moral choices.
- **Google Fonts**: Using **Anton** paired with a sharp, contrasting serif, every letter drips with weight and intention.
- **Git**: Keeping track of our journey into the void—organized, precise, and efficient.
- **Figma/Sketch**: Where the ideas came to life before they were coded into reality.

## **🔑 Key Features**

- **🎭 Parallax Scrolling**: Simulates depth and a sense of diving into the unknown, bringing the player closer to the heart of the narrative.
- **🩸 Custom Blood Trail Cursor**: Every movement leaves a trace—a reminder that your choices stain this world.
- **🧠 Neuron Animations**: Subtle, firing neurons represent the chaotic inner workings of the protagonist’s mind.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices—whether you’re on desktop, tablet, or mobile, the experience remains intense and focused.
- **🎨 Artistic Typography**: A powerful combination of *Anton* and a carefully chosen serif to evoke control, tension, and madness.
- **🔁 Hover & Interaction Animations**: Thoughtful, almost imperceptible shifts give feedback, enhancing immersion while maintaining thematic subtlety.

## **🎨 Design Philosophy**

Our design embraces the noir atmosphere of **No Truce with the Sinner**, focusing on the tension between clarity and chaos. We emphasize a **dark, minimal aesthetic**, punctuated by red highlights that evoke danger, power, and moral ambiguity.

- **⚖️ Parallax Depth**: The scrolling layers add a dimension of immersion, suggesting that the game world is vast and multi-faceted.
- **🧠 Insanity in Subtlety**: Neural animations reflect the fractured mental state of the protagonist, with movement that feels organic yet unpredictable.
- **🩸 Custom Cursor Effect**: A trail of blood follows your actions, metaphorically linking every interaction to the consequences within the game.
- **🖋️ Typography as Weapon**: Our font choices are deliberate. **Anton** commands attention, while the contrasting serif pulls the user into a reflective state, mirroring the game's narrative weight.
